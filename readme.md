# Polling Layout Instability

The scope of this demo is to illustrate the problem (and workaround) with layout shifting caused by appending DOM elements above the contents in the user's viewport.

For example, if you have a list of Tweets which is being updated in real time sorted by most recent on top. The new elements will be added to the top and the user will experience jumping, equal to the height of the new element.
